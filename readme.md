# [maligrad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kZGt592YTsWSrcWA9) is a small numpy-array-based autograd engine

Inspired by [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).

Currently very memory inefficient, but who cares.
It's not useful in any way other than me getting somewhat familiar with stuff like this works.
